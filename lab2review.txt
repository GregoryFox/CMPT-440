Correctness:

- The program produces correct output.

- The program produces output in the correct format.


Style:

- Both files have some style problems. You are not following the style
  guidelines in full.

- Incorrect indentation in both the driver and ManWolf files. Please use a
  two-space indentation.

- Poor block comments

- Both files have incorrect method header formatting. Each function must have a
  comment block before it, which gives the function name, describes each
  parameter and the return value (if any), and explains the purpose of the
  function. Refer to the parameters by name, not by type. Here is an example:
/**
 * factorial
 *
 * This function computes the factorial of the given input. The factorial is
 * defined as factorial(n) = n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   n: the number on which to compute the factorial
 * 
 * Return value: the factorial of n, or 1 if n <= 0.
 */
public static int factorial(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

- Code (or comments) go beyond 100 characters. Keep lines of code short.
  Optimally 80 characters, but no more than 100.

- Classes do not have a description. Each class declaration must have a comment
  block before it, which gives the class name and describes the purpose of the
  class. Here is an example:
/**
 * SinglyLinkedList
 *
 * This class implements a linked list with single forward links, and supports
 * dynamic addition and deletion of nodes.
 */
public class SinglyLinkedList {
  // ...
}



Efficiency and Other Comments:

- Program is efficient as implemented.

- The driverDFA.java file is incorrecly named as: ManWolf.java

- The ManWolf.java file is incorrectly named as: Driver.java 


CSV files:

- CSV files contain State-transition table and description of states.

- Usually in state-transision tables, the rows are the states, and columns are
  the alphabet.
